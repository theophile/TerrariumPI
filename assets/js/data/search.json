The screenshot above is from version 0.3. The date of the screenshot is from august 2014. The gui did had already editing settings, but I think a lot of settings was still in .cfg files. Which was manual editing and restarting the software after every change.WeatherOn the screenshot you can see various weather information. The data was coming from Yr.no. But they changed their API, and now we use OpenWeatherData. But the used data is still the same.The two suns on the left and right side show the sun rise and sun set values. This is real weather data based on a geo position. Ths sun in between shows how far the day is done. So the small sun in the middle will go from left to right during the day.And one temperature indicator is used to show the current weather temperature.System statusOn the left side there are some small system indicators. They show if the different part of the system are running correctly. This is only a status view.RelaysIn the middle we have four relays, of which two are toggled on. We used ‘old-shool’ look relays on the page. The names are embossed on the right side in the relay.When a relay is toggled on, the lightbulb will be on. This looked pretty nice.SensorsWe had two types of sensors. Temperatures and humidity sensors. Other sensors where not supported. It looks clear what is what type of sensors. With warning/error indicators.EnvironmentAnd finally on the right side we have the configured environment. You can see the lights setup, with a heater and sprayer setup.The green check marks shows that an area is active.The small light bulbs show if the relays are on or not.The small timer icon you could set timer settings.And finally, all the icons in the middle are animated. The big light bulb goes on and off when the relays are on or off. The heater flames are animating when the heater was active."},{"title": "TerrariumPI version 2.5","url": "/TerrariumPI/posts/2017/06/28/terrariumpi-version-2-5/","categories": "Website, News","tags": "release","date": "2017-06-28 12:00:00 +0200","snippet" : "Release 2.5I found an old screenshot of TerrariumPI.

It took so much time as it is almost a complete rewrite. That was not planned, but it did happen.The idea was to create a better REST API so that it would be easier to integrate. Unfortunately that did not succeed, so we have lost about 6 months testing and creating all kinds of code. So for now, the API is changed, but the documentation is not. So that did not succeed.But the biggest improvement is that we now can support multiple enclosures with multiple areas. So that means that you do not need a Raspberry PI per enclosure anymore. And that you can have now two or three heating area’s with their own configuration.And the timing for the lights is updated and more clear how to setup.So, go the installation page in order to install Terrarium PI version 4."},{"title": "Release TerrariumPI v 4.1.0","url": "/TerrariumPI/posts/2021/12/10/release-terrariumpi-v-4-1-0/","categories": "Website, News","tags": "release, 4.1.0","date": "2021-12-10 22:00:00 +0100","snippet" : "Release 4.1.0A new release after just for the end of the year. So this is the Christmas release! With this release we have a lot of new features, new hardware support and some bugfixes. Get the new version here.Here are some highlights of this release.Climate mirroringIt is now possible to mirror temperature and humidity from a given weather location. This will means that the temperatures will be changed during the day based on the previous day on the selected location. And if you have dimmers running some heaters, they will increase and decrease nicely during the day.This is all based on the selected weather location in the weather settings. Using the variation tab on an area, you can select weather as a variation source.Area sensor variationsLike the climate mirroring it is also possible to change the sensor values according to a specified schema. So if you want to have a certain temperatures at 10:00, at 14:00 and 20:00, you can now set this up in the variation tab.Area dependenciesAnother big feature is the ability to let area depending on each other. This way, you can prevent a sprayer system to run dry if the water tank is getting low on volume. If you select the water tank as depending area in the sprayer/humidity area, the sprayer will only operate when it needs based on the selected rules, and when the depending water tank has no alarm. As soon the water tank is on low volume, and the alarm is shown, the sprayer will not operate anymore.This can be done with almost any area. Disable water heaters when the water tank is empty is now also possible.Docker supportAlso with this new version, there is docker support. This should make it easier to upgrade and install the software. As this is still new, it could be that there are some bugs. If you found one, please report. Thanks to @alec-pinson!This also means that you can run TerrariumPI on a newer Debian (Bullseye). Natively you still need Debian buster.New hardwareIn this release we also have some new hardware that we support. Those are the Qwiic Relay and newer relay cards of Sequent MicrosystemsSo, go the installation page in order to install Terrarium PI version 4."},{"title": "Release TerrariumPI v 4.2.0","url": "/TerrariumPI/posts/2022/02/13/release-terrariumpi-v-4-2-0/","categories": "Website, News","tags": "release, 4.2.0","date": "2022-02-13 12:00:00 +0100","snippet" : "Release 4.2.0This release has a lot of small fixes and the main goal was to speedup the software. Also this release will support more hardware. Get the new version here.Here are some highlights of this release.Speed improvementsWith this release the GUI now supports compressed javascript and css files. During the installation the .gz files are created and the webserver will serve the gzipped files when the browser asked for a compressed file. This should save about 40% of bandwidth during the loading of the GUI.Also there are some changed in the code so there is less database usage, which should also make the GUI a bit more responsive.New hardwareIn this release we also have some new hardware that we support. This is a new bluetooth sensor called LYWSD03MMC which is a look a like of the MiTemp sensors. Thanks to Charles NelsonNotificationIn the notification settings we have support for LCD and OLED displays.

This way, you could add more buttons and GPIO relays though I2C bus. This expander boards can only toggle ports on or off. It is not possible to use it for sensors.Area updatesThere were some bugs in the area setting of an enclosure. Those are fixed and there is a new feature. You can now ignore alarm values per area if needed. So for the low alarm tab, you can now ignore the low alarm, and only use the high alarm value for toggling relays.Also there is a better check for depending areas. So when the area you depend on turns in an alarm state, it will also shutdown the area that depends on it.HardwareWe now support SHT4X and BME680 sensors and RTSP based webcams.Also we support hardware PWM again like the old legacy way in TP3.So, go the installation page in order to install Terrarium PI version 4."},{"title": "Release TerrariumPI v 4.3.1 and 4.3.2","url": "/TerrariumPI/posts/2022/05/05/release-terrariumpi-v-4-3-1-and-4-3-2/","categories": "Website, News","tags": "release, 4.3.1, 4.3.2","date": "2022-05-05 10:00:00 +0200","snippet" : "Release 4.3.1 and 4.3.2The release 4.3.1 is a small update which will fix some small bugs and updates some libraries. This will also add the SHT3XD sensor as a new sensor. It appears this sensor works a bit different than all the other SHTXX sensors.And there is a nasty bug fixed with the pca9685 dimmer when running in Docker.In release 4.3.2 we fixed a FFMPEG issue. This was a result of missing OS libraries, and this will need to update your docker-compose.yaml file. The path /opt/vc/bin is changed to /opt/vc so we can also use the lib folder which is needed for FFMPEG.This release has a lot of small fixes. Also this release will support more hardware.

Also there are translation updates and we have a new language Catalan. Get the new version here.Or, go the installation page in order to install Terrarium PI version 4.Here are some highlights of this release.I2C MultiplexerTerrariumPI is tested with an I2C multiplexer in order to add more I2C buses to the Raspberry PI and the ability to add fixed address sensors/relays on different buses. And this support is just in the Raspberry PI OS. Just connect it to the first I2C bus and add a single line to the file /boot/config. More can be found here.HardwareThere is now support for 2 new dimmers. The first dimmer is the I2C 4 channel LED AC dimmer. This is a dimmer that can control up to 4 electrical devices.The other dimmer is the LED-Warrior18 dimmer. This is a DC dimmer that can control 2 electrical devices.And we should be able to support majority of the AtlasScientific sensors.Bug fixesThe following bugs are fixed: A nasty time table bug when using the climate mirror mode. This mostly happens when the difference in timezones was around 10-12 hours. Fixed BrightPI support. Try to improve the overall speed. It looks it is a bit faster, but it is also depending on the used hardware and Raspberry Pi version."},{"title": "Release TerrariumPI v 4.5.0","url": "/TerrariumPI/posts/2022/10/29/release-terrariumpi-v-4-5-0/","categories": "Website, News","tags": "release, 4.5.0","date": "2022-10-29 13:00:00 +0200","snippet" : "Release 4.5.0With this new release we have upgraded the weather logic in order to support multiple versions of the OpenWeatherMap API. Fixed a nasty bug rotation if log file gets rather big. Multiple database updates and fixes in order to improve crash recovery. Also there are translation updates. Get the new version here.Or, go the installation page in order to install Terrarium PI version 4.Here are some highlights of this release.OpenWeatherMap API 3.0OpenWeatherMap introduced the One Call API 3.0 which means that the old 2.5 version is not active available for new users. This means not that when you make an account at OpenWeatherMap you will only get the free data. Which is lacking history data for climate mirroring. But when you add an API 3.0 subscription, which is still free, but needs some credit card info, you will get all the needed weather data again. More information here.For existing OpenWeatherMap users they can still use the 2.5 version of the API.TerrariumPI will auto detect which version of the API you have and can use.Log rotationWhen the log file is getting big, more then 100 MB, it could take to much time to rotate and compress that the TerrariumPI is forced to restart by the OS. Because there is no update within the 2 minutes system check. This has been fixed to do the log rotation in a new thread, which is not blocking the main engine thread anymore. Still it takes some time and CPU and disk time, but it should not cause a timeout which will trigger a restart.Database tuningIn order to speedup the software the database is not crash resistance. It can cover restarts, but power outages could corrupt the database. Now there is a tunning setting to change the way the database preforms. This will slow down the software a bit, but it should not get corrupted when there is a power outage. More information can be found hereIf the database does get corrupted, then there is now also a small script which can fix the database. Make sure that you have enough disk space left as there will be made a full copy of the database. Read this FAQ how to fix.Bug fixesThe following bugs are fixed: Better check if notification services are enabled during startup. Fix daylight detection when main lights are disabled. Codacy suggested code updates."},{"title": "Release TerrariumPI v 4.6.0","url": "/TerrariumPI/posts/2022/12/11/release-terrariumpi-v-4-6-0/","categories": "Website, News","tags": "release, 4.6.0, gui, svelte","date": "2022-12-11 12:00:00 +0100","snippet" : "Release 4.6.0 - Early christmas presentWith this release we have rewritten the complete GUI. We added some new hardware and some other hardware has been tested, fixed and confirmed to be working. Also the Docker build has been reduced to only 10 minutes and the size has been reduced by 33%. And we made some code updates to improve stability.Get the new version here.Or, go the installation page in order to install Terrarium PI version 4.Here are some highlights of this release.New GUI build with SvelteThe GUI is completely rewritten using Svelte reactive javascript framework. This is a new reactive framework which works very easy and very fast. In the old GUI we used a lot of jQuery which is not always the best way to do it. Also with Svelte there is a better memory management and better timer control on reloading data. The GUI itself looks almost the same, but some forms will be smaller and only showing fields that are needed based on choices. With this new GUI we hope that the interface feels a bit more like an app and less sluggish.Translation changesWith the new GUI, we had to change the translations. Now there are two parts. There is a backend part, which is used by the daemon that is doing all the updates and running the code on the Raspberry PI. The GUI part, is like the name says, the GUI or front-end. This has been separated because there are two different ways of translating. And therefore, we need to have two translation parts.We have tried to merge the old translations into the new parts. But some translations could be lost. And all missing translations are now translated with Google translate. And therefore, also some translations could be wrong. Please feel free to update it here.New and fixed hardwareWe do now support remote buttons through remote JSON data. In order not to overwhelm the remote server, you can specify how often it will update the button state. This will make the option to add remote doors in TerrariumPI.The Atlas Scientific sensors are now tested and working. So all available sensors can be used.Docker optimizationsWith the new GUI we had to look at the Docker build setup. And it turned out we could improve it a lot. The first Docker build was not very optimized. Now we have downgraded the Python version to the same version as on the Raspberry PIs. That way we can use the Piwheels python package builds and speed up the build enormously. And looking into the installed packages we could remove some which made the image also a lot smaller.There is one change in the Docker-compose.yml file which should be updated with this release. You should remove the mount volume /opt/vc as this now build on the image it self.

These are: Replacing hardware modal at a relay Restarting TerrariumPI in a Docker setup and disabling the reboot and restart Pi menu options on DockerAnd we have some new interesting logic feature. Relay dependencyAnd there is a way to use a single relay in multiple areas. A much asked feature. Read more about it in the FAQ.The translations English, German, Dutch are updated.Updated some documentation about different dependency options. And updated a lot of other documentation pages.

You can now select in an area other relays of which this are depends on. And that depending on can be like all other relays needs to be on, or at least on needs to on. This allows some ‘relay sharing’ logic.GUI updatesWe have updated the GUI to use Svelte 4. It should produce smaller code and therefore the GUI should load a bit faster.On the dashboard there was a nasty bug. Areas running on a timer mode did on show the current begin and end time, and not the operating window begin and end time. This has been fixed.We also added an indicator at the light sensors when there is a light threshold calibrated. It will lit up when the threshold is reached.We have now a loading modal when loading the webcam archive. As this can take some time when there a lot of pictures, we have now a nice waiting notification with a counter.Changed the alarm icon on the dashboard. It will now only turn red when the alarm does trigger a relay. When there is an alarm, but no relays to toggle, the icon stays gray. Indicating an alarm triggered but no relays to act on.New hardwareYou can now live stream a RTSP webcam. This will disable the Raspberry PI cam streaming. As it uses the same GPU hardware.FixesWe increased the system watchdog timeout to 3 minutes. This will give some more time to start TerrariumPI up with faulty hardware. At least the GUI should be able to start now when there are some errors.Better closing I2C connections when a sensor is failing. Else you could get system error messages about to may open files. Which will case system crashes and/or reboots.The Python code is now formatted according to the Black rules.And the code has been more cleaned up. And we have a code quality of A at Codacy. Fixed Pi Zero installation script. TerrariumPI should now install correctly on a Pi Zero. Thanks to @Awakawaka.

This way you get automatically seasons following the season outside. More…It is also possible to mirror the temperature and humidity of the weather at the given location. This can be set on every temperature or humidity controlled area. And per area you can even select an offset, so you can create shade area and a full sun area based on the same climate. Look at the variation tab to set this up.But you can even enter an external JSON source for climate mirroring. Look How to use remote data FAQ how to add the correct url.MultilingualThe software is translated to multiple languages. This will also select the correct currency, number and date formatting. If you language is not available or is not complete, go to the translation page to see how to update it.Multiple enclosures and multi areasIt is possible to control multiple enclosures with a single Raspberry PI. As long you can hook up enough sensors and relays, you can create unlimited enclosures and areas.In every enclosure you can create multiple areas, even of the same type, to setup your enclosure. So you can create a sun spot area and a shading spot area that have their own settings and logic in the same enclosure.Costs indicationBased on the entered power and water usage per relay and with the power and water price in the settings page, we can make an estimate of the running costs of your terrarium. Keep in mind this is an estimate, and does not handle big price fluctuations.Data encryptionSome data is sensitive like the authentication password or the cloud credentials. This data is stored encrypted in the TerrariumPI database. That means when you database is lost, your passwords will not be compromised directly.There is a difference in how the data is encrypted.Admin passwordThe admin password is encrypted one way in a hash, and that hash is checked with the entered login credentials. This password cannot be reverted back to plain text if you loose it. But you can reset itFor encryption we use bcrypt.Other sensitive dataCloud credentials are stored with symmetric encryption. This means that the data can be reverted back to plain text. This is needed to able to login to the cloud providers. TerrariumPI is logging as ‘you’.For encryption we use Fernet encryption with the CPU serial as salt. As every CPU has it’s own serial, the salt is unique and locked to your Raspberry PI.DockerYou can also install a Docker image to make the installation easier. More information can be found at installation page"},{"title": "Hardware","url": "/TerrariumPI/hardware/","categories": "","tags": "","date": "2021-05-05 10:07:10 +0200","snippet" : "GPIOAll the hardware that is connected through GPIO pins needs to use the physical pin number as address. This means a number from 1 - 40.Power savingSome GPIO sensors can benefit from using power saving. A good example is the analog/digital moisture sensor YTXXPower management works that you connect the red (power) wire of the sensor to a GPIO pin, which will be put to high so that the sensor get powered. After 1.0 sec a measurement is taken, and afterwards the power to the sensor is shutdown.When you want to enable power saving just enter an extra GPIO pin number, where the RED power cable is connected to, to the address separated by a comma.Ex: [GPIO Readout pin],[GPIO power saving pin]remark: Not all sensors will work with power management.Analog sensorsIt is possible to add analog sensors to TerrariumPI. But as TerrariumPI only has digital GPIO ports, an extra add-on is needed to add analog ports. For now the RaspIO Analog Zero is known to work. But any MCP3008 based board should work. The downside is that you will miss some GPIO pins for other use.I2C busBy default there is only 1 I2C bus available. But it is possible to add more I2C busses to your Raspberry PI. To select a different I2C bus then 1, use the following address notation:&amp;lt;I2C Address&amp;gt;,[I2C Bus number]&amp;lt;I2C Address&amp;gt; is mandatory and you can use the number shown in the i2cdetect. Adding ‘0x’ in front is allowed. So either 3c, 3c,1, 0x3c and 0x3c,1 are valid and the same I2C addresses.The [I2C Bus number] is optional and can be omitted. The default value is 1.Run the command i2cdetect -y 1 in order to see what is connected to your I2C bus. A correct working I2C bus should produce the following outcome:123456789 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d e f00: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --10: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --20: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 27 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --30: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 3c -- -- --40: 40 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --50: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --60: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --70: 70 -- -- -- -- -- -- --I2C MultiplexerWith an I2C multiplexer you can add more I2C busses to TerrariumPI. Support for I2C multiplexers depends on the support in the OS. For now there is support for pca9542 (2 channel), pca9545 (4 channel), and pca9548 (8 channel) muxes.I2C IO ExpanderThere is support for two I2C IO Expanders so you can have extra GPIO relays or GPIO buttons if needed. This will update the GPIO address to:pcf857&amp;lt;4/5&amp;gt;-&amp;lt;IO expander port&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;I2C Address&amp;gt;,[I2C Bus number]Either use pcf8574 or pcf8575 to select the used IO expander.&amp;lt;IO expander port&amp;gt; is mandatory and is a number from 0 till max ports - 1.&amp;lt;I2C Address&amp;gt; is mandatory and specified here.RelaysWe currently support 30 types of relays.

Make sure you are using the Legacy version! This is Debian Buster.This is very important, as the Desktop and/or the new OS version will not work well with the GPIO pins and Raspberry PI cameras.Also 64bit is not supported due to missing mmal code which is needed for the webcams.Creating SD CardDownload and instal the Raspberry Pi Imager to prepare your SD card. Make sure you have a SD card of at least 4GB of size. Bigger is better :) Make sure you select Raspberry Pi OS Lite (legacy) from the other Raspberry Pi OS images.In order to enable SSH, Wifi and other settings, click on the settings icon in the lower right corner. Here you enter your Wifi settings, pi password etc. Use this to install the Raspberry PI headless. Add the SD card in the Raspberry PI and withing a minute you should have a running Raspberry PI.TerrariumPIWhen the Raspberry PI is up and running, you should be able to SSH to it. On Linux and Mac you can use the terminal. For Windows, you can use Putty.1ssh pi@[raspberrypi]Disclaimer: If you have TerrariumPI 3 running on this Raspberry PI, then you can read here how to stop and make a backup.DockerAs from version 4.1 there is a Docker image that can be used to run TerrariumPI. When you run it in Docker, you can skip the rest of the page. Only the migration could be followed if you want to restore your current relay history.Install docker according to: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/ Just follow the installation steps. And to run the docker commands as a normal user, follow these stepsThen you need to setup a docker-compose.yaml file. There is an example docker-compose.yaml.example in the contrib folder which can be used as a starting point:12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031version: &quot;3.7&quot;services: terrariumpi: image: theyosh/terrariumpi:latest # Or use a specific version volumes: - /opt/terrariumpi/logs:/TerrariumPI/log - /opt/terrariumpi/data:/TerrariumPI/data - /opt/terrariumpi/media:/TerrariumPI/media - /opt/terrariumpi/scripts:/TerrariumPI/scripts - /opt/terrariumpi/webcam-archive:/TerrariumPI/webcam/archive - /opt/terrariumpi/DenkoviRelayCommandLineTool:/TerrariumPI/3rdparty/DenkoviRelayCommandLineTool - /boot/config.txt:/boot/config.txt - /boot/cmdline.txt:/boot/cmdline.txt - /etc/modules:/etc/modules - /dev:/dev network_mode: host restart: unless-stopped privileged: true cap_add: - NET_ADMIN stop_grace_period: 1m stop_signal: SIGINT init: true environment: TZ: &quot;Europe/Amsterdam&quot; # timezone list can be found here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones ENABLE_I2C: &quot;true&quot; ENABLE_1_WIRE: &quot;true&quot; ENABLE_CAMERA: &quot;true&quot; ENABLE_SERIAL: &quot;true&quot; ENABLE_CO2_SENSORS: &quot;true&quot; AUTO_REBOOT: &quot;true&quot;The only real setting is the TZ value. Make sure it is set to your local/home time zone. A valid list can be found here.We run the container with privileged enabled. This is less secure, but needed in order to be able to handle all the hardware that is connected to the Raspberry PI.The network mode needs to be at host. Else bluetooth with not work, and you can’t use bluetooth sensors.then you can run docker compose up -d to start the docker image. It could be that it needs a reboot. After that, you should be able to access TerrariumPI on the url http://[raspberrypi]:8090. Continue with the setupManualPrerequisitesFirst we need to install Git. This is used to download the software from Github.com1sudo apt -y install gitDownloadAfter Git is installed, we can download the TerrariumPI source code. We will only download the latest version.If you want to do some development or testing, omit the part --depth 1. Then you will get the full repository with all the branches.1git clone --branch main --depth 1 https://github.com/theyosh/TerrariumPI.gitInstallationAnd the final step is to start the installer. This will guide you through the installation process.The first time you run the installer, it will also update the Raspberry PI OS to the latest version. This can take some more time.Make sure you select the correct timezone. This is your home timezone. If you do not select the correct timezone during installation, you could get strange time schedules when running TerrariumPI.12cd TerrariumPIsudo ./install.sh After the installation is done, reboot once and you should be able to access TerrariumPI on the url http://[raspberrypi]:8090. Continue with the setupMigration from V3 to V4There is no real migration from version 3 to version 4. The changes are to big. So that means you have to install TerrariumPI v4 as it was a new PI. These migrations steps will only copy the existing relay history data from V3 to V4 so that the total power and water usages is still there. And the total costs are still correct. This is all what will be migrated.If you do not care about your relay history, you can just skip this migration. This is the only data that will be migrated!BackupSo make sure you have stopped the old TerrariumPI. And rename the folder TerrariumPI to TerrariumPI.old. This way you have a backup of your existing working setup. Stop TerrariumPI 3. Wiki Make a backup of existing version. mv /home/pi/TerrariumPI /home/pi/TerrariumPI.old First setupNow, install TerrariumPI v4 as described here. And then you need to set it up as you want. So that means adding at least all the relays you want to use/migrate. When that is done, shutdown TerrariumPI 4 and continue with the last migrations step.Migrate First make sure you have an backup of files of the old V3 version: settings.cfg history.db Stop the TerrariumPI service before start migrating. sudo service terrariumpi stop Enter the new TerrariumPI V4 directory. cd /home/pi/TerrariumPI Enter the Python3 virtual environment. source venv/bin/activate Enter the contrib folder where the file copy_relay_history.py is located. Run the script copy_relay_history.py with the following parameters in this order: full path to OLD config (settings.cfg) full path to OLD database (history.db) full path to NEW database (terrariumpi.db) Answer the questions asked by the script. This should match your old and new relays, in order to copy the historical data.123456789101112131415Found 7 out of 8 are found.

EncryptedWeatherPopup form adding/updating the weather sourceWith the weather data you can schedule your light system based on the sun rise and sun set. This can either be at your home location, or any other location. The sun rise and set times will be shifted to your home location times. So when it is day at 08:00 at the given location, TerrariumPI will thread that as 08:00 local time. This way, you can have seasons with shorter and longer days, based on day of the year.Other weather data is just for show. Does not have a function.SetupIn order to use the weather system, you need to create a free account at OpenWeatherMap.As from October 2022 they changed the conditions to a free account. Which means that we have fewer data to work with. This also means no history data for climate mirroring out of the box. If you have created an account before that date, you should still be able to use the One call API 2.5 which does hold all the needed information. With One call API 3.0, you need an extra (free) subscription which needs credit card data.For everybody that is registed with OpenWeatherMap after October, will have less data or you have to subscribe for the One call API 3.0The url format needs to be https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=[City],[Country]&amp;amp;appid=[API_KEY]. Do not add the &amp;amp;metric= part in the url.TerrariumPI does about 6-10 calls on the One call API per day, what would result in 300 calls max per month. And it can detect which API is available with your OpenWeatherMap account.RelaysPopup form for adding and updating relays - Calibration is only available for dimmersAdding and changing relays is done with the above relay form.

You can even add images here. Doors The door sensors that are used for this enclosure. Magnetic sensors. Webcams One or more webcams that are used in this enclosure. Webcams selected here can use the archive light state and archive door state option at the webcam settings.AreasAdding and changing areas is done here. But as areas have a but more functionality, they are discussed per area type. The most important is that there is an area configured as main lights as this will influence the timing of other areas if they depend on the timing of the main lights. Without this, the system will not work.Also make sure that the light area has relays configured at the Day settings tab.Depending on the combination of Type and Mode some fields are disabled and not used. The values that are shown will be ignored during the operating of the software.Three fields are always required and shared in all the area types: Enclosure Select the enclosure to which this area belongs. Type Select the type of area. Depending on the type, new/different options are available. Name The name of the area. Use an easy to remember name.Main LightsPopup form for adding and updating areas Mode Select the operating mode of this area. Use timer for custom on and off times. Weather is using your configured weather data Minimum hours Enter the minimum hours that the lights should be on. If the day based on the weather data is shorter, the lights will stay on for at least this amount of time. Maximum hours Enter the maximum hours that the lights should be on. Reverse of minimum hours. Hours shift Shift the time that the lights should go on based on the weather sun rise. Can be a positive or negative decimal value (ex: -1.3) Main lights Toggle this if the lights are the main lights on the enclosure. This is used for other areas that depend on this light area. Make sure at least one light area has the toggle main lights setThen you need to setup at least the Day settings tab else the software will not work. Do not use the same relay in the day and night settings. That does not work. A relay configured in the day settings part, will be off during the night period.In the day and night setting tab you can configure the following: Begin time Depending on the selected mode you can enter the start time when the relay(s) should go on. End time Depending on the selected mode you can enter the end time when the relay(s) should go off. The duration between begin and end time we call the operating window On duration Depending on the selected mode you can fine tune the time that the relay(s) should on in minutes time. Enter a value of 0 to put the relays on for the complete operating window time. Off duration Depending on the selected mode you can enter the amount of minutes the relay(s) should be off during the operating window. Enter 0 to disable.Timer functionality: When you have an operating window of 10 hours, and selected 45 min on duration and 15 min off duration, you will get a that the relays will toggle on at the start, run for 45 minutes, and go off for 15 minutes. As this is in total 1 hour, this will be repeated 10 times during the operating window time. Relays Here you select the relay(s) that needs to be controlled. When you select a relay, depending on the type, you will get extra tabs where you can either set the on/off dimming duration or relay delay when the relay(s) are toggled on or off.Simulate sun rise/set: When you select a dimmer and a normal relay, you could setup the dimmer to go on in 30 minutes, and delay the normal relay for 30 minutes, so that when the dimmer is at full power, the other light is toggled on. This will give a nice sun rise effect.Other areasThere are multiple types of areas that can be used. Almost all types have the same logic, but the type of area is of influence on the used sensors. In the screenshot below you see the Humidity type area. But for CO2, Conductivity, Cooling, Heating, Moisture, Fertility, PH this is all the same. Only audio and watertank are special areas which have their own setup.The system uses the sensors alarm values to determine the right conditions you want. For example, using an area with a heater relay and temperature sensors will try to get the temperature in the middle of the minimum and maximum sensor values. Either by using a dimmer or by just toggling on and off. By changing the sensor alarm values, you can raise or lower the wanted temperature. This is the basic logic we use.Popup form for adding and updating areas Depends on Here you can select other areas on which this area depends on. If the depending area is in an alarm state, this area will not toggle on, or if already on, toggle off. For example you have a water tank area and a humidity area where you use a sprayer. When the water tank is (near) empty the low alarm of the water tank will go on, and this humidity area will then not toggle on. Protect against dry running the water sprayer. Mode Same as lights area Sensors Select the sensors you want to use with this type of area. The area will use the average values of the current, min and max alarm values. Day/night difference Enter the a value that the sensors should raise or lower when it become night. Enter a negative value for lowering the temperature. When it become day again, the sensor values will go the opposite direction and return to normal.Leave it 0 if you are planning to use the variation tab Day/night source Select the day and night source. This can either be the main lights or weather. This is used for light settings later on the day or night tabs.Next you can configure either the Low alarm or High alarm tab. This is optional. When you do not select at least 1 relay in these tabs, you will only get a summary for that area with no actions. The Variation tab is described separately.Make sure you do not select a relay more then once in these tabs and areas! Begin time Depending on the selected mode you can enter the start time when the relay(s) should go on. End time Depending on the selected mode you can enter the end time when the relay(s) should go off. The duration between begin and end time we call the operating window On duration Here you can fine tune the time that the relay(s) should on in minutes time. Enter a value of 0 to put the relays on for the complete operating window time. Off duration Here you can e enter the amount of minutes the relay(s) should be off during the operating window. Enter 0 to disable. Power on time Here you can even more fine tine the on duration. The value here is in seconds. When this value is higher then 0 the relay will on for this amount of seconds and will then toggle down. Settle time The time between two relay actions. This is a value in seconds. This means that when the relay goes off, it will wait this amount of time before it will toggle on again. This value is also affective between the Low alarm and High alarm. Light status Select the state of the lights. If the light state is not in the selected state here, the relays will not toggle and power down. This depends on the option Day/night source you have selected earlier. Door status Select the state of the doors. If the door state is not in the selected state here, the relays will not toggle and power down. Alarm threshold The amount of errors that have to pass before the relays toggles on. Relays Select the relays that you want to use for this area. Make sure a relay is only used once!VariationWith the variation tab, you can fine tune the alarms of the sensors during the day so that you can have for example different temperatures during the day. Or you can even mirror a remote climate setting the source on Using current weather.Area variation tab Source Select the variation type. Depending on this option, some fields will hide and other shows up. Period/duration Depending on the source, you fill in a time or a duration in minutes. Value Depending on the source, the new value that should be set at the selected time External source url This is only available with the source option Use json source and Use script Offset This is only available with the source option Using current weather, Use json source and Use script. This is a value that will be added to the wanted current value.AudioPopup form for adding and updating audio areas Mode Same as lights area Sound card Select the sound card you want to use to play the audio. Playlists Select all the playlists you want to use. Make sure that the playlist with repeat option is selected as last.Water tankPopup form for adding and updating water tank areasThe water tank area is a bit special. This can be used to measure your water levels in a tank. This is done by using HC-SR04 ultrasonic ranging sensor. Mode Same as lights area Sensors Select the sensors you want to use with this type of area. Only distance sensors can be used here. Water volume Enter the total amount of water that the tank can hold in litres Height Enter the height of the water tank in centimeters Offset Enter the distance between the sensor and the top of the water level in centimetersOther options are the same the other areas. You can use water pumps to fill your water tank based on the alarm values."},{"title": "Scenarios","url": "/TerrariumPI/scenarios/","categories": "","tags": "","date": "2021-05-05 10:07:10 +0200","snippet" : "On this page you can find various information on how to setup areas and create scenarios.Timer wizardUsing the weather or timer mode in an area, you can set the following 6 fields. The minimal fields that needs to be entered are the begin and end time field. All other fields are optional. Using a value of &#39;&#39; or 0 will ignore the setting. Change some values in the form to see the outcome of the timer schedule.The graph area in red is the time the relay(s) are toggled onAnd when you have selected sensors, used light state or door state, then the relay will only go on when that state is met during the on period in the red are of the graph. Operating window Begin time * End time * Enter the begin and end time off the operating window in which the relay(s) may operate Timer periods On duration Off duration Enter a duration in minutes where the relay(s) are toggled on and off. This will create timer(s) Fine tuning Running time Settle time Enter a duration in seconds which the relay(s) are on and the settle timeout DependenciesThere are multiple dependencies levels. Here we describe all the different dependencies that are possible to use.General dependenciesThere are 2 basic dependencies. When you choose something other than Ignore, then the selected option will be enforced. These are:Light statusOnOffIgnoreDoor statusClosedOpenIgnoreIn the above example we have a raining area setup which will toggle the relays &#39;Mister&#39; and &#39;Sprayer&#39; when the humidity is to low. But, there are 2 dependencies selected and active.- In this case, the main lights needs to be on, so it is day, and the water of the sprayer can vaporize.- And the door needs to be closed. So you are sure that when you are working in the terrarium, and the door is open, you will not get wet.Area dependencyHere you can select other areas on which this area depends on. If the depending area is in an alarm state, this area will not toggle on, or if already on, toggle off.For example you have a water tank area and a humidity area where you use a sprayer. When the water tank is (near) empty the low alarm of the water tank will go on, and this humidity area will then not toggle on.This will protect the water sprayer against running hot/dry when there is no water.Relay dependencyWith relay dependencies you can make extra complex logic. A possibility is to &#39;share&#39; a relay between two areas. As the basic rule is that a relay can only be used once. In order to &#39;share&#39; a relay between the areas you need to create a new third area. In the third area you can select a timer window to toggle the &#39;shared&#39; relay on. And select the relays used in the other two areas as dependening relays. And choice that at least one on dependency mode.This way the relay in the third area will only go on when one of the selected relays of other areas are on.When you select depending relays, you also need to select the dependency mode.There are 3 dependency modes:All onAt least one onNone onIn the example above we have selected an area which is controlling a fan. This will clear the air in the terrarium and should be running when there is either the rain relay is toggled on or the mister relay is toggled on. In this case, those relays are in different areas with different logic.The fan should be on based on a timer from 08:00 till 20:00 hours. This is a 12 hour on time.But with the selected dependency relays, this area will only go on when on of the two selected relays is on. And when there is no depending relay is on, the power of this area will also shut down. So the fan will only be running when either the mister is running, or the sprayer is running.You can also use the &#39;Power on time&#39; and &#39;Settle time&#39; values to fine tune."},{"title": "Notifications","url": "/TerrariumPI/notifications/","categories": "","tags": "","date": "2023-05-14 11:42:47 +0200","snippet" : "The notification system is divided in two parts. There is a notification system service which can be email, push over, or http API calls. And there are notification actions. Like sensor alarms, door openings.Rate limitsBoth the service as the message has a rate limit setting which controls the amount of message per minute are send. If you set a rate limit in the service setting, than that rate limit will count for all messages send through that service.For a single message you can rate limit it for only that message. So an update message can be rate limited to 3 a minute while other messages are not rate limited.Use the value 0 for unlimited amount of message, no rate limit.ServicesThere are multiple services available which can be used multiple times. So you can have configured three email addresses to send messages to. But you can also add email and push over and sent alarms through push over and other through email.Rate limiting is explained here.BuzzerWith the buzzer you can play some songs when there is a warning. You can only play the songs that are shown in the list. Make sure you copy and past the song name and put it in the subject of the message.Connect the buzzer to a GPIO pin and enter the physical pin number as address.DisplayWe support multiple types of displays. There are 2 and 4 lines LCD displays as small OLED displays. When a display is used, it will show a summery after every update run.For address enter the I2C address.EmailHere you can setup the receiving email address and the account details for sending the email. It needs the server address and port together with a username and password to be able to send out emails. It will auto detect TLS/SSL connection options to use.The receiver email address does not has to be te same as the used account for sending emails.MQTTYou can use a MQTT service to send messages and act on based on the content or topic with other clients. It will auto detect TLS/SSL connection options to use.Enter the server address, port number, username and password in the form to connect to a MQTT server. It will connect with a client id: TerrariumPI {version}. It will start the full topic location with terrariumpi. From there you will get sub topics based on the message type. If there is an ID in the data (from a sensor), than this ID will also used as a subtopic. This way you can subscribe to sensor warnings for a single sensor.Subscribe, for example, for a topic: terrariumpi/sensor/warning/1234567/ to get only sensor warnings for sensor id 1234567. You can use wildcards * in the topic path.The contents is in JSON and contains all the data that is available as a place holder and some extra fields:123456{ &quot;uuid&quot; : &quot;&quot;, &quot;topic&quot; : &quot;&quot;, &quot;subject&quot; : &quot;&quot;, &quot;message&quot; : &quot;&quot;}And expect all the place holder fields that are available for the specific message type. The field uuid contains a unique ID so you can track if the message has been processed by logging this ID somewhere.It will not send files, as that will make the messages to big.Pushover For push over you need to enter the API token and user key in order to make a connection. These can be found/created in your account at Pushover.You can then receive messages with the subject and message you entered in a notification message.When you selected the system_error message type, you should get a siren sound when you receive a system error message for extra attention.Traffic lightThe traffic light works a bit different. It will only work on system warnings and errors. So if you select this for a different message type, it will not react.It uses three GPIO address for the different colors/lights.When there is a system warning, the amber light will be lit for 5 minutes. When there is an error, the red light will be turned on for 15 minutes. If there is no warning or error message after the timeout, the lights will go off and only the green light will be on.Web-hookEnter a full url where the data is posted to. The data is in JSON format. The will contain the following data:123456789101112{ &quot;message&quot; : &quot;&quot;, &quot;subject&quot; : &quot;&quot;, &quot;uuid&quot; : &quot;&quot;, &quot;type&quot; : &quot;&quot;, &quot;files&quot; : [ { &quot;name&quot; : &quot;&quot;, &quot;data&quot; : &quot;&quot; } ]}The files are optional. So check if it is in the JSON data. The data of the file is in base64. This can be used to send webcam images.The field uuid contains a unique ID so you can track if the message has been processed by logging this ID somewhere.MessagesThere are several messages types you can use. Select one from the message type options. When selecting for example for sensor changes, you will get a message for each sensor that is changing. At this point it is not possible to have a single message for a single sensor or relay.Rate limiting is explained here.Place holdersIn the subject and message field you can use place holders for actual data in the messages. Use the format ${name} will use the name of the sensor or relay in the message. Where name is the place holder name that is available in the list of place holders on the right side of the form. Use ${now} for the current date and time when the message is created.For example based on the screen shot above. We can create a subject with the value Button ${name} is pressed. And for the message you can enter something like:123456The button ${name}(${id}) is pressed on ${now}The current state is ${value}Kind regardsTerrariumPIYou can also use ${now:%d-%m-%Y %H:%M} for a custom date format.For number formatting you can use the following place holder code: ${value:.2f} will show the current number value with 2 decimals accuracy.More information about (python) text formatting can be found here.Destination servicesAll the services you have setup will show up as an icon which you can click on to enable or disable to send the message through that service.

Cleanup database If TerrariumPI is running for years it happens that the database get rather big and therefore slowing down the system. Also deleting the data will not give back the disk space. So there is a script which can cleanup the database and reclaim disk space by reducing the database.In order to cleanup the database, make sure that TerrariumPI is stopped! Else there is a possibility on database corruption.When you cleanup the database, we need at least the same amount of free space as the size of the database. The script will check this. Make sure you have enough free diskspace. If this is a problem, you can also try to download the database and run this on a desktop/laptop.The cleanup can take up to 10 hours!. So make sure your environment is stable and can survive for that period. Enter the TerrariumPI folder: cd /home/pi/TerrariumPI/ Enable Python3 virtual environment: source venv/bin/activate Go to the folder ‘contrib’: cd contrib Run the command: python db_cleanup.pyThis will start the script. It will first show some information about required disk space and how much data will be kept.123456789101112131415161718This script will cleanup your terrariumpi.db file. We will keep 420 days, 0:00:00 of data from now. If you want to make a backup first, please enter no and make your backup.Database size: 2.04 GB, free diskspace: 5.19 GBWould you like to continue?

This will take a lot of timeDone in 10.43 secondsDatabase is now cleaned and should be reduced in size:Database size: 2.04 GB, free diskspace: 172.71 GBRestart TerrariumPI and check if the sensor graphs still working. If it is al working, remove the file ../data/terrariumpi.db.oldWhen this done, you can restart TerrariumPI again. Check if all graphs are working. If that is the case, you can delete the backup database at the location ‘data/terrariumpi.db.old’: rm ../data/terrariumpi.db.old Custom logging By default all logging is done in the folder log where the actual log files are written to a temporary memory share. This is done to reduce the write wear on the SD card. A downside is that when the Pi reboots, all log info of that day is gone. During the night, the log file will be archived and that is stored on the SD card. So archived log files will survive reboots.In order to change the default logging of TerrariumPI you only need to create your own custom logging configuration file with the name logging.custom.cfg and place that in the log folder. So start with:cp logging.cfg log/logging.custom.cfgAnd start editing the log/logging.custom.cfg file with an editor. After editing restart TerrariumPI and the new logging will be loaded.Enable debugIn order to enable debug messages add the fileHandlerDebug handler to the handlers in section [logger_root]Syslog (local and remote)In order to enable (remote) syslog logging add the syslogHandler handler to the handlers in section [logger_root]. Then you have to configure to use either the local syslog server or a remote syslog server. By default it uses the local syslog. To use remote change:&#39;/dev/log&#39; to (&#39;hostip&#39;,portnr)Local: args=(&#39;/dev/log&#39;,&#39;local6&#39;)Remote: args=((&#39;192.168.1.1&#39;,514),&#39;local6&#39;)Next you need to tell Syslog which facility it is using. The default is LOCAL6. To enable this, create a file in the folder /etc/rsyslog.d for example:/etc/rsyslog.d/terrariumpi.confAnd add then:local6.* /var/log/terrariumpi.logFinally restart rsyslog and you should receive log messages from TerrariumPI Energenie USB is not found / auto detected Some Energenie USB devices are to new to detect with the current software. In order to make those Energenie USB devices work, you need to manually update a software package and restart TerrariumPI.Upgrade steps can be found hereThis is already done in the Docker image. How to contact There are several ways to contact the developers of TerrariumPI. Here you can see how: Github for feature requests and bugs Try the TerrariumPI Matrix channel Use the email icon in the lower left part of the menu. How to debug TerrariumPI Stop the TerrariumPI service: sudo service terrariumpi stop. Enter the TerrariumPI folder: cd /home/pi/TerrariumPI/ Enable Python3 virtual environment: source venv/bin/activate Manual start TerrariumPI: python terrariumPI.pyThis should start the TerrariumPI in console mode. So all errors should now be visible to the console.When you are done debugging, you can press Ctrl+C once to stop TerrariumPI. How to delete a sensor/relay/button TerrariumPI When you want to delete a sensor/relay/button that has been used for more than 3 months, you should use the manual/debug way to delete the sensor through the GUI. This is due to the time it takes to delete the data from the Sqlite database. If this takes more then 2 minutes, the systemd watchdog will restart TerrariumPI and the delete will not succeed.In order to not have the problem of the 2 minutes watchdog timeout, you have to run TerrariumPI in debug mode. You can stop TerrariumPI as follows.When running in debug mode, you can just go the sensor/relay/button and delete it. Now it does not matter how much time it takes. Just wait until done.If the deleting is done, stop the debug version of TerrariumPI and start normally. How to start/stop/restart and disable/enable TerrariumPI TerrariumPI is using systemd for startup. Here you can find the commands to manually start, stop or restart it. Also there is an option to disable or enable TerrariumPI at boot up.Startrun sudo service terrariumpi start to start TerrariumPIStoprun sudo service terrariumpi stop to stop TerrariumPIRestartrun sudo service terrariumpi restart to restart TerrariumPIEnable startuprun sudo systemctl enable terrariumpi to enable TerrariumPI at startupDisable startuprun sudo systemctl disable terrariumpi to disable TerrariumPI at startup How to use a relay multiple times A much asked question is how can a relay used in 2 or more areas. By default this is not possible, due to the a relay can only be used once policy. This made it a bit easier to make sure that relays stays in the correct state. Even after power failures.But there is a solution. In this FAQ we explain how to setup a relay to used in multiple areas. This can either be a relay or a dimmer. It should work for both.Add original relayFirst add the original relay to TerrariumPI and make sure it works. Enter the power usage and the water usage values. But never use this original relay in any area.Create script relay code Create a scripts folder if not exists: mkdir scripts Copy duplicate_switch.py to the scripts folder: cp contrib/duplicate_switch.py scripts/ Edit the new script to set some settings: nano scripts/duplicate_switch.py Edit the variables RELAY_ID, USERNAME, PASSWORD. The RELAY_ID can be found on the page: http://[TerrariumPI_IP]:8090/api/relays/ When this is all done, you can test if it al works by running the command: scripts/duplicate_switch.py 100 which should toggle on the original relay.Duplicate the relayNow it is easy to duplicate this relay a couple of times. Make sure you are on the scripts folder where the file duplicate_switch.py is placed.Now by running the following command we will create a symlink to the original file. Now you will have 2 files with the same contents and will the same original relay.1ln -s duplicate_switch.py duplicate_switch_2.pyThis can be done multiple times. Make sure you have a unique name for every new symlink.Adding the new relays to TerrariumPINow add the new scripts as new script relay to TerrariumPI. Use as address /home/pi/TerrariumPI/scripts/duplicate_switch.py.But here, do not enter the power and water flow values. Else the amount of used power and water will be counted double. Which is not correct.Now you can use the new script relay in an area. How to use remote data It is possible to use remote data with TerrariumPI. At the moment, only JSON and plain text are supported as content types.Rate limitsIf you use a sensor, relay or any other remote service, make sure that the other side can handle a request every 30 seconds. This is the frequency of the updates.Url formatThe remote data url is a full url to the JSON output appended with a dash ‘#’ and the JSON traversal pathhttp(s)://remote.server.com:portnumber/path_to_json_output#json/traversal/pathExampleRemote source url: https://terrarium.theyosh.nl/api/sensors/e39b7d7931f8db191cedd83f3c80cec4/json output:12345678910111213141516171819{ &quot;id&quot;: &quot;e39b7d7931f8db191cedd83f3c80cec4&quot;, &quot;hardware&quot;: &quot;owfs&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;temperature&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Midden links&quot;, &quot;address&quot;: &quot;2653D18D0100006A&quot;, &quot;limit_min&quot;: 10, &quot;limit_max&quot;: 45, &quot;alarm_min&quot;: 20, &quot;alarm_max&quot;: 30, &quot;max_diff&quot;: 0, &quot;exclude_avg&quot;: false, &quot;calibration&quot;: { &quot;offset&quot;: 0 }, &quot;value&quot;: 23.7188, &quot;alarm&quot;: false, &quot;error&quot;: false}json traversal path: valueConstruct full url by combining the remote source url and the json traversal path joining by a dash ‘#’. Full remote source url: https://terrarium.theyosh.nl/api/sensors/e39b7d7931f8db191cedd83f3c80cec4/#value and that will return the value of ‘23.7188’And for the calibration offset value you need the path #calibration/offset Reset authentication When you loose your password, there is no way to retrieve it. So you need to manually reset it. Use the following steps to clear your existing password, and generate a new one. Stop TerrariumPI (FAQ) Enter the TerrariumPI folder cd /home/pi/TerrariumPI/data Load the database sqlite3 terrariumpi.db Delete admin password delete from Setting where id = &#39;password&#39;; Exit sqlite3 by pressing Ctrl+D Start TerrariumPI (FAQ)Now you should be able to login with chosen username and password password Restoring backup files If you have made regular backups, than you can restore it with the following steps. If the backup has become corrupted, follow these steps first. Shutdown TerrariumPI Remove the old files in data if there are any. rm data/* Place the backup files in the data folder. Place custom logging or webcam archives back in place if needed. Start TerrariumPIThis should start TerrariumPI with the backup-ed data. sqlite3.DatabaseError: database disk image is malformed It can happen that the database gets corrupted. The error message you will get is something like sqlite3.DatabaseError: database disk image is malformedThis can be fixed by replacing it with a backup database. If you do not have backup of that file or the backup is to old, you can try the following steps: Make sure TerrariumPI 4 is not running: sudo service terrariumpi stop Enter the TerrariumPI 4 folder and enable the Python environment: cd /home/pi/TerrariumPI source venv/bin/activate Enter the contrib folder: cd contrib Run the fix_db.py script and answer the questions: ./fix_db.py. This will take some time. When done, the database should be restored. Start TerrariumPI 4: sudo service terrariumpi startA backup of the broken database is left at data/terrariumpi.db.broken. You can delete this database when TerrariumPI is running again. rm data/terrariumpi.db.brokenIf this happens a lot, you could look at the FAQ item: Tune database settings to improve the database storage. Tune database settings Currently the database SQLITE3 settings are setup for speed. And therefore it cannot handle power outages well. If you need for what ever reason a different SQLITE3 setup, you can create a file called data/.database-env with the following contents:1[pragma setting name]=[value]All SQLITE3 pragmas should be supported. Make sure you use the correct pragma name and value. Only the entered values will be overwritten from the default.For example the current defaults are:12345auto_vacuum=NONEcache_size=-10000journal_mode=WALsynchronous=OFFtemp_store=MEMORYIf you need more stability you can use the following settings:1synchronous=FULL What is the default login The default login name is admin with password password. Make sure you change it after installation at the system setting page. Which files to backup If you are running the software for a while, it is handy to backup some files in case of SD card corruption or any other reason that you have to reinstall the software. So here is a list of files that should be saved at a regular basis: data/* - Here is the database and calendar data stored log/logging.custom.cfg (optional) webcam/archive/* (optional) - Here you can find all the archived images of the used webcamsWarningDue to the nature of TerrariumPI, the database can get corrupted during creating a backup. This is due the fact that at least every 30 seconds the database is updated. And that could case that the latest data is not backup-ed correctly. This can be fixed by using the database fix script. After fixing you will probably miss about the last 30 seconds till 30 minutes of data. Which is mostly sensor data.

## Release 4.6.3 - Summer is here release

A new, sort of maintenance, release. But it contains just a bit more ðŸ˜‰

The major update is a feature request from [may 2019](https://github.com/theyosh/TerrariumPI/issues/292) that should now be added. You can add a threshold value per light sensor. Also you can use LDR buttons as feedback sensor. And in the lights area you can select the sensors which are used to check if the light is above the threshold.

Updated some documentation about notification setup and messages. [You can read it here]({% link _tabs/notifications.md %}).

Updated translations GUI and Python to the latest library versions. And cleanup some unused files.

[Get the new version here](https://github.com/theyosh/TerrariumPI/releases/tag/4.6.3).

Or, go the [installation]({% link _tabs/install.md %}) page in order to install Terrarium PI version 4.

### New hardware

You can now [live stream a USB webcam]({% link _hardware/usb-live_webcam.md %}). This will disable the Raspberry PI cam streaming. As it uses the same GPU hardware.

Full support of buttons through an [IO expander]({% link _hardware/io-expander.md %}).

### Fixes

Dimming to **0%** in steps. Some dimmers will not go fully off when going to **0%** value. This has to do that the last change is to small. So solve this, we do a small ramp up to **5%** and than to **0%**. This way, there is a **5%** change, which will fully power off the dimmer.

We fixed the 404 error page. So now you will get a nice 404 error page to see when you try to open a page that does not exists.

Fixed offline live webcam error handling.

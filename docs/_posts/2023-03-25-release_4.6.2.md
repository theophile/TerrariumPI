## Release 4.6.2 - Spring release

This is a maintenance release which fixes a lot of audio player and playlist issues. So tht should now work again.

Than we have fixed the IO expanders pcf857(4/5). The used library is not that stable, and has some bugs. So we had to work around that. And now it should all work correctly. This will also fix the support for [HD30A 4 Channel Electromagnetic I2C Relay 12V 30A]({% link _hardware/hd30a-4-channel_relay.md %}).

[Get the new version here](https://github.com/theyosh/TerrariumPI/releases/tag/4.6.2).

Or, go the [installation]({% link _tabs/install.md %}) page in order to install Terrarium PI version 4.

### New hardware

And [HD30A 4 Channel Electromagnetic I2C Relay 12V 30A]({% link _hardware/hd30a-4-channel_relay.md %}) are now fully tested and working based on the [IO expanders pcf857(4/5)]({% link _hardware/io-expander.md %}).

### Fixes

Other fixes are better webcam retry logic. The camera should try three times before going in offline mode. That was broken, and the offline mode kicked in after 1 error. This is now fixed.

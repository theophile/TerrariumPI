## Release 4.7.0 - Finalizing the software

With this new release we have added some new features, fixed some nasty small bugs, and finished some left over code and functionality.

We also bump the version to 4.7 as with this release all functionality should be rewritten and available to use. These are:

- Replacing hardware modal at a relay
- Restarting TerrariumPI in a Docker setup and disabling the reboot and restart Pi menu options on Docker

And we have some new interesting logic feature. [Relay dependency](#relay-dependency)

And there is a way to use a **single relay in multiple areas**. A much asked feature. Read more about it in the [FAQ]({% link _faq/re-use_relays.md %}).

The [translations](https://weblate.theyosh.nl/engage/terrariumpi/) English, German, Dutch are updated.

Updated some documentation about different [dependency]({% link _tabs/scenarios.md %}#dependencies) options. And updated a lot of other documentation pages. Including upgrading the [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) template. And found a [very early version]({% link _posts/2014-08-28-v0.3.md %}) of TerrariumPI.

Update NodeJS and Python libraries to the latest versions.

[Get the new version here](https://github.com/theyosh/TerrariumPI/releases/tag/4.7.0).

Or, go the [installation]({% link _tabs/install.md %}) page in order to install Terrarium PI version 4.

### Relay dependency

![Relay dependencies](/assets/img/Relay_dependencies.webp)

This is a new feature. You can now select in an area other relays of which this are depends on. And that depending on can be like all other relays needs to be on, or at least on needs to on. This allows some ['relay sharing']({% link _tabs/scenarios.md %}#dependencies-relay) logic.

### GUI updates

We have updated the GUI to use [Svelte 4](https://svelte.dev/blog/svelte-4). It should produce smaller code and therefore the GUI should load a bit faster.

On the dashboard there was a nasty bug. Areas running on a `timer mode` did on show the current begin and end time, and not the operating window begin and end time. This has been fixed.

We also added an indicator at the light sensors when there is a light threshold calibrated. It will lit up when the threshold is reached.

![Webcam archive loading modal](/assets/img/Webcam_archive_loading_modal.webp){: .right width="100" }
We have now a loading modal when loading the webcam archive. As this can take some time when there a lot of pictures, we have now a nice waiting notification with a counter.

Changed the alarm icon on the dashboard. It will now only turn red when the alarm does trigger a relay. When there is an alarm, but no relays to toggle, the icon stays gray. Indicating an alarm triggered but no relays to act on.

### New hardware

You can now [live stream a RTSP webcam]({% link _hardware/rtsp-live_webcam.md %}). This will disable the Raspberry PI cam streaming. As it uses the same GPU hardware.

### Fixes

We increased the system watchdog timeout to **3 minutes**. This will give some more time to start TerrariumPI up with faulty hardware. At least the GUI should be able to start now when there are some errors.

Better closing I2C connections when a sensor is failing. Else you could get system error messages about to `may open files`. Which will case system crashes and/or reboots.

The Python code is now formatted according to the [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) rules.

And the code has been more cleaned up. And we have a code quality of A at Codacy. [![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/dba4e25f9efe4197926dd03aa6925d0f)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/theyosh/TerrariumPI?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=theyosh/TerrariumPI&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Settings)

Fixed Pi Zero installation script. TerrariumPI should now install correctly on a Pi Zero. Thanks to [@Awakawaka](https://github.com/Awakawaka). Still Pi Zero is not actively supported, but it should be able to run the software.

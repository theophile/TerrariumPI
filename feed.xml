These are:</p> <ul> <li>Replacing hardware modal at a relay</li> <li>Restarting TerrariumPI in a Docker setup and disabling the reboot and restart Pi menu options on Docker</li> </ul> <p>And we have some new interesting logic feature. <a href="#relay-dependency">Relay dependency</a></p> <p>And there is a way to use a <strong>single relay in multiple areas</strong>. A much asked feature. Read more about it in the <a href="/TerrariumPI/faq/how-to-use-a-relay-multiple-times/">FAQ</a>.</p> <p>The <a href="https://weblate.theyosh.nl/engage/terrariumpi/">translations</a> English, German, Dutch are updated.</p> <p>Updated some documentation about different <a href="/TerrariumPI/scenarios/#dependencies">dependency</a> options. And updated a lot of other documentation pages. Including upgrading the <a href="https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy">Chirpy</a> template. And found a <a href="/TerrariumPI/posts/2014/08/28/early-terrariumpi-version/">very early version</a> of TerrariumPI.</p> <p>Update NodeJS and Python libraries to the latest versions.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/theyosh/TerrariumPI/releases/tag/4.7.0">Get the new version here</a>.</p> <p>Or, go the <a href="/TerrariumPI/install/">installation</a> page in order to install Terrarium PI version 4.</p> <h3 id="relay-dependency">Relay dependency</h3> <p><img src="/assets/img/Relay_dependencies.webp" alt="Relay dependencies"/></p> <p>This is a new feature. You can now select in an area other relays of which this are depends on. And that depending on can be like all other relays needs to be on, or at least on needs to on. This allows some <a href="/TerrariumPI/scenarios/#dependencies-relay">â€˜relay sharingâ€™</a> logic.</p> <h3 id="gui-updates">GUI updates</h3> <p>We have updated the GUI to use <a href="https://svelte.dev/blog/svelte-4">Svelte 4</a>. It should produce smaller code and therefore the GUI should load a bit faster.</p> <p>On the dashboard there was a nasty bug. Areas running on a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">timer mode</code> did on show the current begin and end time, and not the operating window begin and end time. This has been fixed.</p> <p>We also added an indicator at the light sensors when there is a light threshold calibrated. It will lit up when the threshold is reached.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/Webcam_archive_loading_modal.webp" alt="Webcam archive loading modal" class="right" width="100"/> We have now a loading modal when loading the webcam archive. As this can take some time when there a lot of pictures, we have now a nice waiting notification with a counter.</p> <p>Changed the alarm icon on the dashboard. It will now only turn red when the alarm does trigger a relay. When there is an alarm, but no relays to toggle, the icon stays gray. Indicating an alarm triggered but no relays to act on.</p> <h3 id="new-hardware">New hardware</h3> <p>You can now <a href="/TerrariumPI/hardware/webcam/live-rtsp-camera/">live stream a RTSP webcam</a>. This will disable the Raspberry PI cam streaming. As it uses the same GPU hardware.</p> <h3 id="fixes">Fixes</h3> <p>We increased the system watchdog timeout to <strong>3 minutes</strong>. This will give some more time to start TerrariumPI up with faulty hardware. At least the GUI should be able to start now when there are some errors.</p> <p>Better closing I2C connections when a sensor is failing. Else you could get system error messages about to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">may open files</code>. Which will case system crashes and/or reboots.</p> <p>The Python code is now formatted according to the <a href="https://github.com/psf/black">Black</a> rules.</p> <p>And the code has been more cleaned up. And we have a code quality of A at Codacy. <a href="https://app.codacy.com/gh/theyosh/TerrariumPI?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=theyosh/TerrariumPI&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Settings"><img src="https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/dba4e25f9efe4197926dd03aa6925d0f" alt="Codacy Badge"/></a></p> <p>Fixed Pi Zero installation script. TerrariumPI should now install correctly on a Pi Zero. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Awakawaka">@Awakawaka</a>. Still Pi Zero is not actively supported, but it should be able to run the software.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Website"/><category term="News"/><category term="release"/><category term="4.7.0"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Release 4.7.0 - Finalizing the software]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://theyosh.github.io/TerrariumPI/assets/img/streamers-clipart-celebration.webp"/><media:content medium="image" url="https://theyosh.github.io/TerrariumPI/assets/img/streamers-clipart-celebration.webp" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"/></entry><entry><title type="html">Release TerrariumPI v 4.6.3</title><link href="https://theyosh.github.io/TerrariumPI/posts/2023/06/02/release-terrariumpi-v-4-6-3/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Release TerrariumPI v 4.6.3"/><published>2023-06-02T13:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2023-08-25T12:23:16+02:00</updated><id>https://theyosh.github.io/TerrariumPI/posts/2023/06/02/release-terrariumpi-v-4-6-3</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://theyosh.github.io/TerrariumPI/posts/2023/06/02/release-terrariumpi-v-4-6-3/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="release-463---summer-is-here-release">Release 4.6.3 - Summer is here release</h2> <p>A new, sort of maintenance, release.

We added some new hardware and some other hardware has been tested, fixed and confirmed to be working. Also the Docker build has been reduced to only 10 minutes and the size has been reduced by 33%. And we made some code updates to improve stability.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/theyosh/TerrariumPI/releases/tag/4.6.0">Get the new version here</a>.</p> <p>Or, go the <a href="/TerrariumPI/install/">installation</a> page in order to install Terrarium PI version 4.</p> <p>Here are some highlights of this release.</p> <h2 id="new-gui-build-with-svelte">New GUI build with Svelte</h2> <p><img src="/assets/img/SvelteLogo.png" alt="Svelte logo" class="right" width="100"/> The GUI is completely rewritten using Svelte reactive javascript framework. This is a new reactive framework which works very easy and very fast. In the old GUI we used a lot of jQuery which is not always the best way to do it. Also with Svelte there is a better memory management and better timer control on reloading data. The GUI itself looks almost the same, but some forms will be smaller and only showing fields that are needed based on choices. With this new GUI we hope that the interface feels a bit more like an app and less sluggish.</p> <h2 id="translation-changes">Translation changes</h2> <p><img src="https://weblate.theyosh.nl/widgets/terrariumpi/-/multi-auto.svg" alt="Translation status" class="right" width="150"/> With the new GUI, we had to change the translations. Now there are two parts. There is a backend part, which is used by the daemon that is doing all the updates and running the code on the Raspberry PI. The GUI part, is like the name says, the GUI or front-end. This has been separated because there are two different ways of translating. And therefore, we need to have two translation parts.</p> <p>We have tried to merge the old translations into the new parts. But some translations could be lost. And all missing translations are now translated with Google translate. And therefore, also some translations could be wrong. Please feel free to <a href="https://weblate.theyosh.nl/engage/terrariumpi/">update it here</a>.</p> <h2 id="new-and-fixed-hardware">New and fixed hardware</h2> <p>We do now support remote buttons through remote JSON data. In order not to overwhelm the remote server, you can specify how often it will update the button state. This will make the option to add remote doors in TerrariumPI.</p> <p>The <a href="/TerrariumPI/hardware/sensor/atlasscientific-i2c-sensor/">Atlas Scientific</a> sensors are now tested and working. So all available sensors can be used.</p> <h2 id="docker-optimizations">Docker optimizations</h2> <p><img src="/assets/img/DockerLogo.webp" alt="Docker Logo" class="right" width="100"/> With the new GUI we had to look at the Docker build setup. And it turned out we could improve it a lot. The first Docker build was not very optimized. Now we have downgraded the Python version to the same version as on the Raspberry PIs. That way we can use the <a href="https://piwheels.org/">Piwheels</a> python package builds and speed up the build enormously. And looking into the installed packages we could remove some which made the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/theyosh/terrariumpi">image</a> also a lot smaller.</p> <p>There is one change in the Docker-compose.yml file which should be updated with this release. You should remove the mount volume /opt/vc as this now build on the image it self. Look for an up to date <a href="/TerrariumPI/install/#docker">example here</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Website"/><category term="News"/><category term="release"/><category term="4.6.0"/><category term="gui"/><category term="svelte"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Release 4.6.0 - Early christmas present]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://theyosh.github.io/TerrariumPI/assets/img/streamers-clipart-celebration.webp"/><media:content medium="image" url="https://theyosh.github.io/TerrariumPI/assets/img/streamers-clipart-celebration.webp" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"/></entry><entry><title type="html">Release TerrariumPI v 4.5.0</title><link href="https://theyosh.github.io/TerrariumPI/posts/2022/10/29/release-terrariumpi-v-4-5-0/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Release TerrariumPI v 4.5.0"/><published>2022-10-29T13:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2022-10-29T13:00:00+02:00</updated><id>https://theyosh.github.io/TerrariumPI/posts/2022/10/29/release-terrariumpi-v-4-5-0</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://theyosh.github.io/TerrariumPI/posts/2022/10/29/release-terrariumpi-v-4-5-0/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="release-450">Release 4.5.0</h2> <p>With this new release we have upgraded the weather logic in order to support multiple versions of the OpenWeatherMap API. Fixed a nasty bug rotation if log file gets rather big. Multiple database updates and fixes in order to improve crash recovery. Also there are translation updates. <a href="https://github.com/theyosh/TerrariumPI/releases/tag/4.5.0">Get the new version here</a>.</p> <p>Or, go the <a href="/TerrariumPI/install/">installation</a> page in order to install Terrarium PI version 4.</p> <p>Here are some highlights of this release.</p> <h2 id="openweathermap-api-30">OpenWeatherMap API 3.0</h2> <p>OpenWeatherMap introduced the One Call API 3.0 which means that the old 2.5 version is not active available for new users. This means not that when you make an account at OpenWeatherMap you will only get the <a href="https://openweathermap.org/price">free data</a>. Which is lacking history data for climate mirroring. But when you add an API 3.0 subscription, which is still free, but needs some credit card info, you will get all the needed weather data again. <a href="/TerrariumPI/setup/#setup">More information here</a>.</p> <p>For existing OpenWeatherMap users they can still use the 2.5 version of the API.</p> <p>TerrariumPI will auto detect which version of the API you have and can use.</p> <h2 id="log-rotation">Log rotation</h2> <p>When the log file is getting big, more then 100 MB, it could take to much time to rotate and compress that the TerrariumPI is forced to restart by the OS. Because there is no update within the 2 minutes system check. This has been fixed to do the log rotation in a new thread, which is not blocking the main engine thread anymore. Still it takes some time and CPU and disk time, but it should not cause a timeout which will trigger a restart.</p> <h2 id="database-tuning">Database tuning</h2> <p>In order to speedup the software the database is not crash resistance. It can cover restarts, but power outages could corrupt the database. Now there is a tunning setting to change the way the database preforms. This will slow down the software a bit, but it should not get corrupted when there is a power outage. More information can be found <a href="/TerrariumPI/faq/tune-database-settings/">here</a></p> <p>If the database does get corrupted, then there is now also a small script which can fix the database.

It looks it is a bit faster, but it is also depending on the used hardware and Raspberry Pi version.</li> </ul>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Website"/><category term="News"/><category term="release"/><category term="4.4.0"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Release 4.4.0]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://theyosh.github.io/TerrariumPI/assets/img/streamers-clipart-celebration.webp"/><media:content medium="image" url="https://theyosh.github.io/TerrariumPI/assets/img/streamers-clipart-celebration.webp" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"/></entry><entry><title type="html">Release TerrariumPI v 4.3.3</title><link href="https://theyosh.github.io/TerrariumPI/posts/2022/05/17/release-terrariumpi-v-4-3-3/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Release TerrariumPI v 4.3.3"/><published>2022-05-17T11:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2022-05-17T11:00:00+02:00</updated><id>https://theyosh.github.io/TerrariumPI/posts/2022/05/17/release-terrariumpi-v-4-3-3</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://theyosh.github.io/TerrariumPI/posts/2022/05/17/release-terrariumpi-v-4-3-3/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="release-433">Release 4.3.3</h2> <p>This is again a small update which fixes some annoying bugs.</p> <ul> <li>Starting/stopping of MQTT servers should work now without a restart of TerrariumPI.</li> <li>Fixed total water cost indication.

This will also add the SHT3XD sensor as a new sensor. It appears this sensor works a bit different than all the other SHTXX sensors.</p> <p>And there is a nasty bug fixed with the pca9685 dimmer when running in Docker.</p> <p>In release 4.3.2 we fixed a FFMPEG issue. This was a result of missing OS libraries, and this will need to update your <a href="/TerrariumPI/install/#docker">docker-compose.yaml</a> file. The path <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/opt/vc/bin</code> is changed to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/opt/vc</code> so we can also use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lib</code> folder which is needed for FFMPEG.</p> <p>This release has a lot of small fixes.

This way, you could add more buttons and GPIO relays though I2C bus. This expander boards can only toggle ports on or off. It is <strong>not</strong> possible to use it for sensors.</p> <h2 id="area-updates">Area updates</h2> <p>There were some bugs in the area setting of an enclosure. Those are fixed and there is a new feature. You can now ignore alarm values per area if needed. So for the low alarm tab, you can now ignore the low alarm, and only use the high alarm value for toggling relays.</p> <p>Also there is a better check for depending areas. So when the area you depend on turns in an alarm state, it will also shutdown the area that depends on it.</p> <h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2> <p>We now support <a href="/TerrariumPI/hardware/sensor/sensirion-sht4x-sensor/">SHT4X</a> and <a href="/TerrariumPI/hardware/sensor/bme680-sensor/">BME680</a> sensors and <a href="/TerrariumPI/hardware/webcam/rtsp-camera/">RTSP</a> based webcams.</p> <p>Also we support hardware PWM again like the old legacy way in TP3.</p> <p>So, go the <a href="/TerrariumPI/install/">installation</a> page in order to install Terrarium PI version 4.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Website"/><category term="News"/><category term="release"/><category term="4.3.0"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Release 4.3.0]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://theyosh.github.io/TerrariumPI/assets/img/streamers-clipart-celebration.webp"/><media:content medium="image" url="https://theyosh.github.io/TerrariumPI/assets/img/streamers-clipart-celebration.webp" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"/></entry></feed>
